Moov Watchman is an HTTP API and Go library to download, parse and offer search functions over numerous trade sanction lists from the United States, European Union governments, agencies, and non profits for complying with regional laws. Also included is a web UI and async webhook notification service to initiate processes on remote systems.

Checkout our [demo instance of Watchman](https://moov.io/watchman/) or the [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/moov-io/watchman/blob/master/openapi.yaml) for use with your favorite language.

Docs: [Project](https://moov-io.github.io/watchman/) | [API Endpoints](https://moov-io.github.io/watchman/api/) | [Admin API Endpoints](https://moov-io.github.io/watchman/admin/)

Lists included in search are:

- US Treasury - Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
  - [Specially Designated Nationals](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/sdn-list/pages/default.aspx) (SDN)
    - Includes SDN, SDN Alternative Names, SDN Addresses
  - [Sectoral Sanctions Identifications](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/ssi_list.aspx) (SSI)
- US Department of Commerce - Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)
  - [Denied Persons List](https://bis.data.commerce.gov/dataset/Denied-Persons-List-with-Denied-US-Export-Privileg/xwtd-wd7a/data) (DPL)
  - [Entity List](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/lists-of-parties-of-concern/entity-list) (EL)

All United States or European Union companies are required to comply with various regulations and sanction lists (such as the US Patriot Act requiring compliance with the BIS Denied Person's List). Moov's primary usage for this project is with ACH origination in our [paygate](https://github.com/moov-io/paygate) project.

To get started using watchman download [the latest release](https://github.com/moov-io/watchman/releases/latest) or our [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/moov/watchman/tags). We also have a [demo instance](https://moov.io/watchman/) as part of Moov's demo environment. We also have docker images for [OpenShift](https://quay.io/repository/moov/watchman?tab=tags).

Note: We also offer a `moov/watchman:static` Docker image with files from 2019. This image can be useful for faster local testing or consistent results.

### Web UI

Moov Sanction Search ships with a web interface for easier access searching the records. Our Docker image hosts the UI by default, but you can build and run it locally as well.

![](docs/images/webui.png)

```
$ make
...
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o ./bin/server github.com/moov-io/watchman/cmd/server
...
npm run build
...
Success!

$ go run ./cmd/server/ # Load http://localhost:8084 in a web browser
```

#### Storage

Based on `DATABASE_TYPE` the following environment variables will be read to configure connections for a specific database.

##### MySQL

- `MYSQL_ADDRESS`: TCP address for connecting to the mysql server. (example: `tcp(hostname:3306)`)
- `MYSQL_DATABASE`: Name of database to connect into.
- `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: Password of user account for authentication.
- `MYSQL_USER`: Username used for authentication.

Refer to the mysql driver documentation for [connection parameters](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name).

- `MYSQL_TIMEOUT`: Timeout parameter specified on (DSN) data source name. (Default: `30s`)

##### SQLite

- `SQLITE_DB_PATH`: Local filepath location for the paygate SQLite database. (Default: `watchman.db`)

Refer to the sqlite driver documentation for [connection parameters](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3#connection-string).

##### Postgres ( Version 9.1 and above)

- `POSTGRES_DB`: Name of database to connect into.
- `PGSSLMODE`: Chose what SSL connection option to use. (Default: disable)
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Password of user account for authentication.
- `POSTGRES_USER`: Username used for authentication.
- `POSTGRES_ADDRESS`: Address of server in the form of address:port (example: localhost:5432).

Refer to the Postgres documentation for [environment variables](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/libpq-envars.html).
### Features

- Download OFAC, BIS Denied Persons List (DPL), and various other data sources on startup
  - Admin endpoint to [manually refresh OFAC and DPL data](docs/runbook.md#force-data-refresh)
- Index data for searches
- Async searches and notifications (webhooks)
- Manual overrides to mark a `Company` or `Customer` as `unsafe` (blocked) or `exception` (never blocked).
- Library for OFAC and BIS DPL data to download and parse their custom files

#### Webhook Notifications

When SancionSearch sends a [webhook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) to your application the body will contain a JSON representation of the [Company](https://godoc.org/github.com/moov-io/watchman/client#Company) or [Customer](https://godoc.org/github.com/moov-io/watchman/client#Customer) model as the body to a POST request. You can see an [example in Go](examples/webhook/webhook.go).

An `Authorization` header will also be sent with the `authToken` provided when setting up the watch. Clients should verify this token to ensure authenticated communicated.

Webhook notifications are ran after the OFAC data is successfully refreshed, which is determined by the `DATA_REFRESH_INTERVAL` environmental variable.

##### Watching a specific Customer or Company by ID

Moov Sanction Search supports sending a webhook periodically when a specific [Company](https://api.moov.io/#operation/addCompanyWatch) or [Customer](https://api.moov.io/#operation/addCustomerWatch) is to be watched. This is designed to update another system about an OFAC entry's sanction status.

##### Watching a customer or company name

Moov Sanction Search supports sending a webhook periodically with a free-form name of a [Company](https://api.moov.io/#operation/addCompanyNameWatch) or [Customer](https://api.moov.io/#operation/addCustomerNameWatch). This allows external applications to be notified when an entity matching that name is added to the OFAC list. The match percentage will be included in the JSON payload.

##### Prometheus Metrics

- `http_response_duration_seconds`: A Histogram of HTTP response timings
- `last_data_refresh_success`: Unix timestamp of when data was last refreshed successfully
- `last_data_refresh_count`: Count of records for a given sanction or entity list
- `match_percentages` A Histogram which holds the match percentages with a label (`type`) of searches
   - `type`: Can be address, q, remarksID, name, altName
- `mysql_connections`: How many MySQL connections and what status they're in.
- `sqlite_connections`: How many sqlite connections and what status they're in.

## Generating a Client

We use [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) from the [OpenAPI team](https://swagger.io/specification/) to generate API clients for popular programming languages from the API specification. To generate the Go client run `make client` from Watchman's root directory.

To generate the admin Go client run `make admin`.

## Reporting blocks to OFAC

OFAC requires annual reports of blocked entities and [offers guidance for this report](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Documents/ofac_blocked_property_guidance.pdf). Section [31 C.F.R. § 501.603(b)(2)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=be4f2a1608abec5d93170fb03af99939&mc=true&node=se31.3.501_1603&rgn=div8) requires this annual report.
